# Binary Classification with Perceptron

## Project Overview

This project implements a binary image classification model using a **Perceptron**. The goal is to classify images of **cats** and **dogs** based on pixel features extracted from the images. The images are preprocessed into a data set, which is split into a training set and testing set. The model is then trained using the training data and evaluated on the test data, with performance metrics such as accuracy and error rates calculated`

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Implement a **Perceptron** classifier that can classify binary image data (cats vs. dogs).
- Process and prepare image data for classification by normalizing pixel values, flattening the images, and creating corresponding labels.
- Train the Perceptron model using a training dataset and evaluate performance on a testing data set
- Then visualize the training progress, model accuracy (testing), and its misclassifications.
